    "# Tutorial // Exploring Gender Bias in Word Embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "## https://learn.responsibly.ai/word-embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "Powered by [`responsibly`](https://docs.responsibly.ai/) - Toolkit for auditing and mitigating bias and fairness of machine learning systems 🔎🤖🧰\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gaining an intuitive technical understanding of bias in machine learning systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Exploring the interplay between data, algorithms, application, workflow, and human context when considering responsible AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Audience\n",
    "Everyone, really. No previous knowledge is assumed. If you have a background, you will be able to understand the topic more deeply.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dive into one family of machine learning models/building-block as a scaffolder.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Focus on one example of bias: by gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disclaimers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Word embeddings are not very important by themselves in the context of responsible AI, but bias can be demonstrated with them in an intuitive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We focus on gender bias, and treat it as binary for the simplicity in this work. Nevertheless, gender is a complex social construct, and we should keep it in mind when we go back from a learning context to the real-world.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We don't aim to give a comprehensive overview of neither bias in machine learning nor fairness nor responsible AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you need to work on one of these topics, this workshop is far from being enough, but it can serve as a starting point for your learning path.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. On top of that, it is an active area of research.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. And there is much more to say about this topic, especially from Science and Technology Studies (STS) point of view (but not only).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Therefore, we will provide good learning resources at the end.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "1. This task requires some background with NLP, particularly with training a text classifier in Python.\n",
    "2. Our goal is to learn how word embeddings might affect downstream application from a gender bias perspective, focusing on learning. So we won't follow the best practices in NLP or use the most advanced techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to examine bias in word embeddings is through a downstream application. Here we will use a sentiment analysis classifier of tweets; given a tweet, the system would infer the *valence* of the sentiment expressed in a tweet. The valence is expressed as a real number between 0 and 1, where 0 represents the negative and 1 is for the positive end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is going to be rather simple and consists of three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Preprocessing (e.g., removing stopwords and punctuation, [tockenization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_segmentation#Word_segmentation))\n",
    "2. Transforming the tweets' tokens  into a single 300-dimensional vector.\n",
    "3. Applying logistic regression to predict the valence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to assess the word embedding's impact in its original version and the neutralize-\"debiased\" one on the system bias. We are going to build two versions of that system, each using one version of the two word embedding, and compare its performance on the [Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC)](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/Biases-SA.html), which is designed to assess gender bias in sentiment analysis systems.\n",
